## Implementation of blocks in GNU Radio

## About The Project
The project was to create various new blocks on an open source programme called DNU Radio. Each block had a unique usage and all together made an advanced transmiter and reciever. We also tasted the blocks, to see how well they do on a channel with noise, virtually and physically in a lab. The project was graded with a solid 10 out of 10.
